A personal project I made to help me commute in Lisbon using the Gira Bike System. The premisse is simple, just double-click the map to select an Origin and a Destination and a Route between the closest available stations will be shown in the Map with the estimated trip duration.

This project was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [Emel's Open Data](https://emel.city-platform.com/opendata/).
